<i> Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). In this project, I will try to build a model which can predict whether a user will complete the offer.

## Project Goals

- What is the average age of the Starbucks' customer?
- Which are the most successful offers?
- Determine the success of each offer by gender and age groups.
- Create a ML model to predict who is likely to complete the offer once he/she views the offer given the demographics of the user and offer characteristics.
- Which features will are the main drivers for predicting the user response.

## Datasets

The data is contained in three files:

- portfolio.json - containing offer ids and other attributes about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- profile.json - demographic data for each customer
- transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

## Requirements
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - sklearn
  - plotly
  - matplotlib
